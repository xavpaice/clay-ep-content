# Helm Installation

Install your application on a Kubernetes cluster using Helm charts. Read the docs or select your deployment preferences.

## Requirements

Review the following prerequisites before installing.

- Kubernetes cluster v1.26 or later
- Helm 3.x installed on your workstation
- kubectl configured with cluster access
- StorageClass available for persistent volumes

<Tip title="Before You Begin">
Run `kubectl get sc` to confirm a default StorageClass is available. If no default is set, the installation will fail when creating persistent volume claims.
</Tip>
