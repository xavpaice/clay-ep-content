- 4 CPUs, 8GB RAM, 40GB disk minimum
- Root or sudo access

## Verify Installation

<Tip title="Admin Console Access">
The admin console URL is printed at the end of the installation. Bookmark it — you'll use it to manage updates, check status, and configure the application.
</Tip>

Once the installer completes, it will print the URL for the admin console. Open it in your browser to continue with application setup.

<CommandBlock>
# Check that all pods are running
kubectl get pods -A

# Access the admin console
echo "Admin Console: https://$(hostname):8800"
</CommandBlock>

## Post-Install

See the post-installation documentation for next steps including configuring TLS, setting up backups, and connecting to your identity provider.
